# INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE LEADERBOARD HTML FILE
Files needed in folder:
- leaderboard_1st_script.py                     # first script to go from raw data to final data
- leaderboard_2nd_final_script.py               # second script to go from final data to the final html leaderboard
- data_leaderboard_team_image_link.txt          # data of team and their team image link

- xxxxx_1_raw.txt                               # xxxxx = whatever class the leaderboard will be


## SETUP
Copy and paste the data from the NextOnes leaderboard site, all 150 players
Example:
![highlight_example](/images/highlight_example.png)

Paste all text into file named xxxxx_1_raw.txt
- EX. "juniors_1_raw.txt"
This is how file should look:
RANK
PLAYER_NAME
TEAM
POSITION
OVERALL
...

EX.
1
Fardaws Aimaq
Utah Valley Wolverines
Center
99
2
Kofi Cockburn
Illinois Fighting Illini
Center
98
...


Make sure all needed files are in the folder.

## leaderbaord_1st_script.py
On line 4 set the variable class_name to first word of xxxxx_1_raw.txt
EX.
juniors_1_raw.txt
class_name = ""     ------->    class_name = "juniors"

Save the file

Run in the terminal of the folder:
```shell
python leaderbaord_1st_script.py
```
### Check for errors
Once the script has been ran, there should be a file in your folder named xxxxx_2_final.txt

The file should have the following format, each of these things in one line:
RANK    PLAYER_NAME     TEAM    POSITION    OVERALL     NEXTONES_PLAYER_PROFILE_LINK    TEAM_IMAGE_LINK

EX.
1	Fardaws Aimaq	Utah Valley Wolverines	Center	99	https://nextones.com/player/fardaws-aimaq/statistics	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/samico-nextones.appspot.com/o/college-logos%2Futah-valley-wolverines.png?alt=media
2	Kofi Cockburn	Illinois Fighting Illini	Center	98	https://nextones.com/player/kofi-cockburn/statistics	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/samico-nextones.appspot.com/o/college-logos%2Fillinois-fighting-illini.png?alt=media

Check the file for potential errors.
### POTENTIAL ERROR #1:
Make sure desired amount of players are present. The leaderboard should go all the way to 150.
If not all 150 players are present, that means one player is missing their team.
In the NextOnes leaderboard site some players are missing their team
EX.
![missing_team_example](/images/missing_team_example.png)

Locate the number of the last missing player on the xxxxx_1_raw.txt and click on the player profile with the missing team. Copy and paste the team name from the profile after the player name.
EX.
61                                  61
Jovan Blacksher Jr.     ----->      Jovan Blacksher Jr.
Guard                               Grand Canyon Antelopes
87                                  Guard
                                    87

Once completed save the xxxxx_1_raw.txt
Run in the terminal of the folder again:
```shell
python leaderbaord_1st_script.py
```                             
Check the file again and if all the players are there and it goes to the desired amount move on and check for the next error.

### POTENTIAL ERROR #2:
Missing player slug
If the NEXTONES_PLAYER_PROFILE_LINK for a player says "MISSING PLAYER SLUG" that means that player is not in the data_players_slug.txt.
Go onto the NextOnes website and find the player profile for the missing player.
In the data_players_slug.txt file:
- start a new line at the bottom of the file and type out the players first and last name exactly how it is on the xxxxx_2_final.txt 
- *make sure to separate the first and last name with a TAB*
- after the last name hit tab again and paste the slug, the slug of a player is everything that is between "https://nextones.com/" AND "/statistics"
EX.
xxxxx_2_final.txt:
61	Jovan Blacksher Jr.	Grand Canyon Antelopes	Guard	87	MISSING PLAYER SLUG	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/samico-nextones.appspot.com/o/college-logos%2Fgrand-canyon-antelopes.png?alt=media

data_players_slug.txt:
Jovan	Blacksher Jr.	jovan-blacksher-jr-

Once completed save the data_players_slug.txt and xxxxx_2_final.txt
Run in the terminal of the folder again:
```shell
python leaderbaord_1st_script.py
```

### POTENTIAL ERROR #3:
Missing  team image link
If the TEAM_IMAGE_LINK for a player says "MISSING TEAM IMAGE LINK" that means that team image is not in the data_leaderbaord_team_image_link.txt.
Go onto the NextOnes website and find the player profile and copy the team
Search up the image on google and save the image
save the image name as the team name exactly how it is in the row and make all the letters lowercase and replace all spaces with hyphens "-"
save the image into the firebase storage
In the data_leaderboard_team_image_link.txt file:
- start a new line at the bottom of the file and type out the team name exactly how it is on the xxxxx_2_final.txt 
- after the team name hit tab and paste the firebase image link into the line
EX.
xxxxx_2_final.txt:
4	E.J. Liddell	Ohio State Buckeyes	Forward	96	https://nextones.com/player/e-j-liddell-c82/statistics	MISSING TEAM IMAGE LINK

data_leaderboard_team_image_link.txt:
Ohio State Buckeyes	https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/samico-nextones.appspot.com/o/college-logos%2Fohio-state-buckeyes.png?alt=media

Once completed save the data_leaderboard_team_image_link.txt and xxxxx_2_final.txt
Run in the terminal of the folder again:
```shell
python leaderbaord_1st_script.py
```

If no more errors move onto the next script
## leaderbaord_2nd_final_script.py
On line 4 set the variable class_name to first word of xxxxx_1_raw.txt
EX.
juniors_1_raw.txt
class_name = ""     ------->    class_name = "juniors"

Save the file

Run in the terminal of the folder:
```shell
python leaderbaord_2nd_final_script.py
```
Once the script has been ran, there should be a file in your folder named xxxxx_end_leaderboard_html.html

this is the final leaderboard ready to be put on the site
